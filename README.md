# banking-app-haskell 

This program was written as a way to help the author learn haskell. If you wish to use this project you will need a CSV file containing the (Date, Description, Amount, Balance) in that order. This can be downloaded from some online banks. You will then need to create a directory called 'BankFiles' and place this file in it. Once you have done that you should be able to run the program.
